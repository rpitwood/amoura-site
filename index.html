          <em>A Moura Encantada</em> – the sensual guardian of our spring
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>We are Richard and Evelyn, lovers and co-conspirators in something raw and real. We met through tantra, and that current of breath, presence, surrender and truth has shaped how we love and live.</p>

      <p>Amoura is the community we are building on our former dairy farm in Galicia. This is not just a place to visit, but a way to live that keeps the body at the centre of everything. We cook naked, we sleep entwined, we don’t hide our desires or dress them up in spiritual fluff.</p>

      <p>Our home is Fonte de Mouros, 'Fairy Spring' in Galician. <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moura_encantada" target="_blank">A Moura Encantada</a> </em> is the enchanted, shape-shifting nymph of Galician legend who guards the secrets of the land and tests those who come too casually. She is wild, sensual, and not for the faint-hearted.</p>

      <p>The land here is thick with her presence. It is fertile, and alive with water and stone and stories. We tend it with bare hands and bare skin. We are rebuilding the old barn with chestnut, we bathe under the stars, and dream of a circle of others who long for the same kind of closeness and freedom.</p>

      <p>Amoura is not a concept. It’s a real place, a real body beside yours in the morning light.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="vision">
      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>Amoura is the life we choose, a life of skin, truth, firelight and feeling. We are building a place where bodies are not hidden, where desire is not whispered, and where love in all its forms is lived out loud. This is not a performance, it’s a way of being, and it’s happening here, in the lush hills of Galicia.</p>

      <p>We are not selling enlightenment, we are living touch. We want to wake up each day tangled in warmth, to share food with people who’ve seen each other cry and laugh and come undone. We want to feel the sun on bare skin while planting vegetables. We want deep moans and deep silences, eye contact that lingers, conversations that strip us bare. We want to be held and to hold with nothing in between.</p>

      <p>Amoura is a place for those who are done apologising for needing closeness, who ache for real community where you fall asleep in a pile of limbs after dancing naked around a fire, where jealousy is spoken, not hidden. Here, boundaries are known and respected, and consent is a daily ritual, not a tick box.</p>

      <p>We don’t do shame here. We do slow mornings, shared baths, ritual meals and raw honesty. We do warmth, laughter, tenderness and eroticism that isn’t buried under guilt.</p>

      <p>If you’re longing for that - not in theory, but in the flesh - Amoura is waiting.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Core Principles</h2>

      <p><strong>We live by principles, not fixed dogmas.</strong> These are the values that shape how we move, speak, love, and live together. They adapt to the different energies different people bring to Fonte de Mouros.</p>

      <p><strong>Radical honesty</strong><br>
      We speak the truth, even when it’s messy. We don’t hide behind politeness, we say what we feel. We ask for what we want. We name our limits. And we do all of that with kindness, because honesty without care is just aggression.</p>

      <p><strong>Consensual intimacy</strong><br>
      Touch, closeness, eye contact and shared breath are sacred at Amoura. We treat each gesture as an invitation, not a right. Consent is an ongoing, felt experience, not a tick-box. We listen not just with ears but with bodies.</p>

      <p><strong>Nudity and body acceptance</strong><br>
      We are often naked here, because the body is good. Clothing is optional. Shame is learned behaviour and is not required here. We let our skin show and let our bodies be what they are.</p>

      <p><strong>Polyfidelity and chosen kinship</strong><br>
      We don’t live in pairs, we live in circles. That doesn’t mean chaos or carelessness, it means commitment that isn’t confined to two. We honour deep connections and we tend them like gardens, not cages.</p>

      <p><strong>Shared vulnerability</strong><br>
      We cry in front of each other, we shake, we break down and we’re still loved. We don’t try to fix each other, we hold space and we breathe.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="join">
      <h2>Join Our Circle</h2>

      <p>If what you’ve read so far feels familiar, if it matches how you want to live, then reach out.</p>

      <p>We welcome visitors who want to experience life here as it is: communal, hands-on, intimate. That means joining in with daily tasks, shared meals, honest conversations, and physical closeness. There’s no programme. You just become part of the flow for a while.</p>

      <p>You need to be okay with nudity, with shared spaces, with a culture of touch, affection, and open sexuality. That doesn’t mean anything is expected of you, only that you won’t be disturbed by others living that way around you.</p>

      <p>We’re not trying to impress or convert anyone. This is just how we live: close, open, practical, and honest. If that appeals to you, send us a message and tell us a little about yourself. If it feels like a good fit, we’ll start a conversation.</p>
