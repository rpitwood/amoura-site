      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>Amoura is a sanctuary of radical presence. It is a place where we return to the body, to the breath, to honest speech and intentional silence. We believe that healing, trust, and joy arise not through abstraction but through real human contact — being seen, being touched, being felt.</p>
      <p>Our vision is not escapist or utopian. It is rooted in the soil, in real tasks, in shared meals and awkward conversations. It is not a retreat centre, a therapy group, or a temple — though it may resemble all three at times. It is a place to live the experiment of full-spectrum human connection in a time that has forgotten how.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="principles">
      <h2>Core Principles</h2>
      <p><strong>Radical honesty:</strong> We speak our truth with care, and listen to others with presence. There are no taboos around emotion or desire, but there is a strong culture of consent and responsibility. We aim to speak clearly and live transparently.</p>
      <p><strong>Consensual intimacy:</strong> Intimacy is sacred — not limited to sexuality, nor avoided through shame. We embrace closeness, cuddling, touch, eye contact, and vulnerability, guided always by the principle of mutual invitation and autonomy.</p>
      <p><strong>Naturism and body acceptance:</strong> We reclaim the body from shame and conditioning. Nudity is welcome in all communal spaces. We see the unclothed body not as erotic by default, but as human, sacred, and beautiful in its natural form.</p>
      <p><strong>Polyfidelity and deep connection:</strong> Amoura is not built around couple privilege. We honour a model of love and commitment that is shared, fluid, and deeply intentional — a web of bonds rather than isolated pairs. Jealousy is not shamed; it is processed in community.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="join">
      <h2>Join Our Circle</h2>
      <p>If you feel the call — whether soft or roaring — we invite you to step in gently. Visitors are welcome to come and experience life at Amoura for a few days or weeks. Longer-term guests and potential residents will be invited into deeper conversation and co-creation.</p>
      <p>We do not offer luxury or ease. What we offer is presence, authenticity, shared labour, and shared rest. Expect early mornings, shared chores, deep rituals, strong tea, difficult talks, soft eyes, warm fires, and the possibility of real belonging. If that speaks to your soul, write to us.</p>
