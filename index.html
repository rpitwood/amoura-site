    <em>A Moura Encantada</em> – the sensual guardian of our spring
  </figcaption>
</figure>



  <p>We are Richard and Evelyn, lovers and co-conspirators in something raw and real. We met through tantra, and that current of breath, presence, surrender and truth has shaped how we love and live.</p>

  <p>Amoura is the community we are building — not just a place to visit, but a way to live that keeps the body at the centre of everything. We cook naked. We sleep entwined. We don’t hide our desires or dress them up in spiritual fluff. We live them, out loud, in love, with care.</p>

  <p>Our home is Fonte de Mouros — the Fairy Spring in Galician. The Moura Encantada is the enchanted shape-shifting nymph of Galician legend who guards the secrets of the land and tests those who come too casually. She is wild, sensual, and not for the faint-hearted. Just like the life we are building.</p>

  <p>The land here is thick with her presence — mossy, fertile, alive with water and stone and stories. We tend it with bare hands and bare skin. We are rebuilding the old barn with chestnut, we bathe under the stars and dream of a circle of others who long for the same kind of closeness and freedom.</p>

  <p>Amoura is not a concept. It’s a real place. A real fire. A real body beside yours in the morning light.</p>

<section id="vision">
  <h2>Our Vision</h2>
  <p>Amoura is the life Evelyn and I are choosing — a life of skin, truth, firelight, and feeling. We are building a place where bodies are not hidden, where desire is not whispered, and where love — in all its forms — is lived out loud. This is not a performance. It’s a way of being. And it’s happening here, in the lush, wild hills of Galicia.</p>
  <p>We are not selling enlightenment. We are living touch. We want to wake up each day tangled in warmth, to share food with people who’ve seen each other cry and laugh and come undone. We want to feel the sun on bare skin while planting vegetables. We want deep moans and deep silences. Eye contact that lingers. Conversations that strip us bare. We want to be held — and to hold — with nothing in between.</p>
  <p>Amoura is a place for those who are done apologising for needing closeness. Who ache for real community — not the polite kind, but the kind where you fall asleep in a pile of limbs after dancing naked around a fire. Where jealousy is spoken, not hidden. Where boundaries are known and respected. Where consent is a daily ritual, not a checkbox.</p>
  <p>We don’t do shame here. We don’t do hierarchy. We do slow mornings, shared baths, ritual meals, raw honesty, and bodies that belong. We do warmth, laughter, tenderness, and eroticism that isn’t buried under guilt.</p>
  <p>If you’re longing for that — not in theory, but in the flesh — Amoura is waiting.</p>

<section id="principles">
  <h2>Core Principles</h2>

  <p><strong>We live by principles, not rules.</strong> These are the values that shape how we move, speak, love, and live together. They’re not fixed dogmas — they’re alive, like we are.</p>

  <p><strong>Radical honesty</strong><br>
  We speak the truth, even when it’s messy. We don’t hide behind politeness or perform intimacy. We say what we feel. We ask for what we want. We name our limits. And we do all of that with kindness, because honesty without care is just aggression.</p>

  <p><strong>Consensual intimacy</strong><br>
  Touch, closeness, eye contact, shared breath — these are not casual at Amoura, they are sacred. We treat each gesture as an invitation, not a right. Consent isn’t a tick-box — it’s an ongoing, felt experience. We listen not just with ears, but with bodies.</p>

  <p><strong>Nudity and body acceptance</strong><br>
  We are often naked here — not to shock or seduce, but because the body is good. Clothing is optional. Shame is not required. We let our bellies hang, our skin show, our bodies be what they are. No one is perfect here. That’s the point.</p>

  <p><strong>Polyfidelity and chosen kinship</strong><br>
  We don’t live in pairs. We live in circles. That doesn’t mean chaos or carelessness — it means commitment that isn’t confined to two. We honour deep bonds. We name our connections. We tend them like gardens, not cages.</p>

  <p><strong>Shared vulnerability</strong><br>
  We cry in front of each other. We shake. We break down. And we’re still loved. That’s the real foundation here — not strength, but softness. We don’t try to fix each other. We hold space. We witness. We breathe.</p>
</section>


<section id="join">
  <h2>Join Our Circle</h2>

  <p>We don’t have an application form. If what you’ve read so far feels familiar — if it matches how you want to live — then reach out.</p>

  <p>We welcome visitors who want to experience life here as it is: communal, hands-on, intimate. That means joining in with daily tasks, shared meals, honest conversations, and physical closeness. There’s no programme. You just become part of the flow for a while.</p>

  <p>You need to be okay with nudity, with shared spaces, with a culture of touch, affection, and open sexuality. That doesn’t mean anything is expected of you — only that you won’t be disturbed by others living that way around you.</p>

  <p>We’re not trying to impress or convert anyone. This is just how we live — close, open, practical, and honest. If that appeals to you, send us a message and tell us a little about yourself. If it feels like a good fit, we’ll start a conversation.</p>
</section>

  <p>We don’t need a CV. We just want honesty.</p>
