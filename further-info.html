    <section>
      <p>Amoura is not a resort, retreat centre, or commune with rules posted on the wall. It’s a living, evolving community — rooted in land, ritual, shared bodies, and deep human connection. If that sounds unusual, good. It is.</p>

      <p>We welcome visitors who understand that this isn’t a place you consume — it’s something you participate in.</p>

      <h3>✦ Who Is Welcome</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Individuals and couples curious about open intimacy, trust, and community</li>
        <li>Families who want to raise their children without shame or secrecy</li>
        <li>Volunteers looking for honest exchange — not just free lodging, but a chance to live communally and contribute meaningfully</li>
        <li>Potential long-term residents exploring a shared life rooted in connection</li>
      </ul>

      <p>We don’t care what you look like, how old you are, or what spiritual label you do or don’t use. What matters is that you can live respectfully alongside others — especially when nakedness, intimacy, or strong emotions are part of daily life.</p>

      <p>You don’t have to be extroverted. You don’t have to be polyamorous. But you do need to be open to sharing space, stories, and the occasional silence. If you need rules for everything, or struggle when others live differently — this might not be your place.</p>

      <h3>✦ Ways to Visit</h3>

      <h4>1. Guest Stays</h4>
      <p>For 1–7 nights. You’ll join the rhythm of the household — shared meals, sleep spaces, work time, rest, rituals. Ideal for those curious to dip in without expectation.</p>
      <p><em>Suggested donation: sliding scale depending on means. We’ll discuss it together.</em></p>

      <h4>2. Workaway and Volunteers</h4>
      <p>Come for 1–4 weeks to help with gardening, building, cooking, cleaning, or any skills you bring. In exchange, we offer food, shared living, and immersion in the life of the tribe.</p>
      <p><em>This is not a free hostel. You live as one of us — not as a guest watching from the edge.</em></p>

      <h4>3. Long-Term Visitors and Potential Residents</h4>
      <p>If you’re considering living here — whether part-time or full-time — we ask for a minimum stay of one week, including conversations about our values, agreements, and lifestyle. We’re not in a rush. If it’s a fit, we’ll know.</p>

      <h3>✦ Accommodation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Shared beds or futons in group spaces</li>
        <li>Outdoor sleeping in summer (tents, platforms, hammocks)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some private options exist for those needing space, but don’t expect hotel-style privacy. You’ll hear others breathing, dreaming, making love, or snoring. Children and parents often sleep together in shared spaces. If you’re unsure about communal sleeping, let’s talk — we can often find creative solutions.</p>

      <h3>✦ Meals and Daily Life</h3>
      <p>We eat together at least once a day, cook together, and wash up together. We aim to eat what the land gives us, and consume locally where possible. We do our best to accommodate dietary needs — please let us know in advance if you have allergies or specific requirements.</p>

      <p>We also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tend the land and gardens</li>
        <li>Care for animals</li>
        <li>Bathe communally (indoors or outside, depending on the weather)</li>
        <li>Share stories, rituals, music, and affection</li>
      </ul>

      <p>There’s no schedule on the wall, but the rhythm is strong.</p>

      <h3>✦ Intimacy, Consent, and Norms</h3>
      <p>Nudity is normal. So is affection. So is sex — whether solo, partnered, or shared — when it arises naturally, with consent. That doesn’t mean you’ll see orgies in the kitchen. What it does mean is that no one is expected to pretend, or hide the fact that they love, touch, or desire.</p>

      <p>We practice:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Active, ongoing consent</strong> — every touch is optional</li>
        <li><strong>Clear communication</strong> — especially about boundaries</li>
        <li><strong>Emotional honesty</strong> — including tears, silence, and uncertainty</li>
        <li><strong>No pressure</strong> — you’re never expected to do anything</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If you’re here, it’s because you want to live among people who live with their hearts and bodies open. Not 24/7, not perfectly, but intentionally.</p>

      <h3>✦ How to Contact Us</h3>
      <p>We ask all potential visitors to speak with us first. This might be a voice message, a call, or just a WhatsApp chat — whatever suits.</p>
